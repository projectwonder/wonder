These tools are written for Bourne shell (speficially GNU bash, version 3.2.48(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin11)) and are intended to be
as re-usable as possible. They will work with Mac OS X and, probably, Linux. Nothing has been done to make them work with Windows.

They assume the existence of a "logs" directory. This could be paramterized if anyone cares.

Any suggestions to make them more cross-platform or more usable are welcomed. ray hat(british) ganymede d0t org
