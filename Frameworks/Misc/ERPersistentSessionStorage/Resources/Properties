#The number of seconds for which a session may be idle before it times out.
#The default is 3600 seconds (one hour). A value of 0 means sessions never
#time out.

#The WOSessionStore removes session automatically at a specific interval.
#The problem is it does not check to see if the session is distributed.
#In order to prevent one instance from removing a session which another 
#instance might be using, we turn it off by making the interval the max
#integer value possible. This should be sufficient to prevent premature
#session deletion unless you plan on having an app uptimes > 24 days.

#ERXResponseRewriter uses weak references to pages in order to store
#the information about the resources sent to a page. That does not work
#for persistent sessions, because the weak references are garbage collected
#after the session is serialized. This property should make no difference
#when using in-memory sessions, but is necessary for persistent sessions,
#especially if you plan on using Ajax.
