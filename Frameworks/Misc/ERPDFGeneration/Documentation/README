ERPDFGeneration provides both a utility class and a wrapper component for generating
PDF documents from XHTML markup. Three PDF generation engines are currently supported, 
FlyingSaucer (xhtmlrenderer) [1] and Useful Java Application Components (UJAC) [2],
and Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) [3].
This is still experimental and the API may change as it evolves. You should test
thoroughly before using this in production.  

See the ERPDFExamples application in Examples/Misc/ERPDFExamples for demonstrations
and sample code to render XHTML and XML to PDF.
