The WOTested application is a very simple application that can keep track of
information from testing results submitted to it.

Please check with the Project Wonder list (see http://www.wocommunity.org) or
send an e-mail to Ray Kiddy (ray@ganymede.org) if you have questions or
suggestions.

Thank you for your support.
