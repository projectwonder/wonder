ERPDFExamples


This example application exercises some of the features of the ERPDFGeneration framework.
It is not (yet) comprehensive so there is plenty of room for someone to add demonstration
and tutorial code. This app came from trying to exercise some new wrappers to handle
FOP in addition to the other existing rendering technologies. 

This application requires no database or external files. The important pieces to notice
with respect to FOP are the style sheets (which are held in the classpath of the application
and loaded as resource streams). The following lines in the Properties file show how a component
with ERFOPWrapper wrapped content can read the location of the resource from the properties file.
There are many more pieces of the process that can (and should) be managed through properties,
but that can be added later. 

This property setup is intended to be simple to use subclasses to render different transforms
because you can look up this property using getClass().getName() rather than explicitly setting
this for each component

#########
# Property to point to an xsl transform sheet in the class path
# This is looked up by the component that produces the pdf
xsl.xml2fop.er.pdfexamples.components.SimpleHTML2FOP2PDF=er/pdfexamples/xsl/xhtml2xslfo.xsl
xsl.xml2fop.er.pdfexamples.components.SimpleXML2FOP2PDF1=er/pdfexamples/xsl/testxml2fo.xsl

Other than that, there is not that much to the example. Know that the FOP transform is
picky about well-formed XHTML (XML) and knowing about entities, so this will not 
fix ill-formed content.
