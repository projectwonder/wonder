To run this example in Eclipse, you will first need to disable
the WOAdaptor settings provided in your run/debug configurations. 
Otherwise, that value will override the WOAdaptor property set in 
the properties file. 
 
To do that, right click on the ERWebSocketExample project folder in 
the WO Explorer tab. Select "Debug as -> Debug Configurations". In 
the dialog window that appears, make sure ERWebSocketExample is 
selected on the left hand side. If you do not see the project listed 
there, you must "Debug as -> WOApplication" at least once before it 
will appear. 

Once you've done that, select the 'WO' tab and scroll down the list 
of checkboxes until you find the flag '-WOAdaptor WODefaultAdaptor'. 
Uncheck that box, click the apply button, then debug again. You should 
now be able to run the example application using the WONettyAdaptor 
that provides websocket support.
