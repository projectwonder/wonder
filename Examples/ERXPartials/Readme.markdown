# ERXPartials Test / Example

## Notes about ERXPartials

### Sponsored By

Work on this package was partly funded by [Logic Squad][logicsquad].


### Design Overview

1. `ERXPartialBaseModel` contains a very basic model containing the Root entity
for the partials named **Person**.
	- contains one standard relationship to **GenderType**
	- contains a standard migration to create the initial tables for the
	**Person** and **GenderType**
	- the migration also preloads some default values for gender and 100
	semi-random Person records.

2. `ERXPartialExampleModel` contains additional extensions to the **Person**
entity.  The design uses two partial entities.
	- one partial entity **Partial_AuthenticatedPerson** stores the basic
	authenticated user details *username*, *password* and *lastLoginDate*
	- the second entity **Partial_EmployeePerson** stores common employee
	details like *department*, *employeeType*, *salary* and *employeeNumber*
	- **Company**, **Department** and **EmployeeType** provide additional
	relationships for the **Partial_EmployeePerson**
	- the migration in this frameworks creates the supporting tables in a normal
	fashion, and adds the additional attributes and constraints to the existing
	**Person** table.
 
3. `ERXPartialExampleApp` is a simple D2W demo application to demonstrate and
test the Partials in a live environment.


### Generated Partial entity Templates

By default I was using the `_WonderEntity.java` template, however there was a
small issue with the generated content.  When the template created a to-Many
accessor method, it was using the relationship *actual destination* entity to
generate the appropriate key path.  However when the destination is a ERXPartial
entity then the *actual destination* is the Root Entity.  In this example the
Department relationship to the **Partial_EmployeePerson** was generated as

#### Bad
	  public NSArray<er.example.erxpartials.model.Person> partial_EmployeePersons(EOQualifier qualifier,
	    NSArray<EOSortOrdering> sortOrderings, boolean fetch) {
		  ...
          EOQualifier inverseQualifier = new EOKeyValueQualifier(er.example.erxpartials.model.Person.DEPARTMENT_KEY,
            EOQualifier.QualifierOperatorEqual, this);

#### Should be
	  public NSArray<er.example.erxpartials.model.Person> partial_EmployeePersons(EOQualifier qualifier,
	    NSArray<EOSortOrdering> sortOrderings, boolean fetch) {
	      ...
	      EOQualifier inverseQualifier = new EOKeyValueQualifier(er.example.erxpartials.model.Partial_EmployeePerson.DEPARTMENT_KEY,
	        EOQualifier.QualifierOperatorEqual, this);

A patched `_PartialWonderEntity.java` is included int the Resources of the
`ERXPartialExampleModel` project.


### Validation

The original behaviour for validation forwards ***all*** messages from the
ERXPartial object to ***all*** contained partials.  The problem is that only
***one*** of this partials will correctly validate the specified key path, the
other partials will throw exceptions for unbound keys.

Additionally when the `ERXPartialInitializer` merges the partial entities into
the Root, the `EOEntities` for the partials are removed from the `EOModel`, so
it is not possible to query the original partial entity to determine if the key
path is valid for that partial object.

My solution is currently to generate a static array for the attributes and the
relationships and have the `ERXPartialGenericRecord` query the partial to
determine the validity of a given key path before forwarding the invocation.

Patches for this are included in the `ERXPartial`, `ERXPartialGenericObject`
classes and support is also added to the `_PartialWonderEntity.java` template.


## Getting Started

The example application (`ERXPartialsExampleApp`) can be run against any
database. As shipped, it runs on an in-memory H2 instance. It has also been
confirmed to work using FrontBase and PostgreSQL.

### [H2][h2]

Out of the box, `ERXPartialsExampleApp` runs on a private, in-memory H2
instance. This is for simplicity, and just to prove that it worksâ€”you can run
the application immediately, log in, and browse the entities. The interesting
part, though, is examining the entities that are created, and the `Person` table
in particular. For this, you need to persist the database, or at least allow
multiple simultaneous connections to the in-memory database. There are a couple
of options for doing this with H2.

#### Using a shared in-memory database

You can use a named in-memory database in server mode, but you need to start it
up _before_ you start the application. Using a connection URL like:

    jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost/mem:ERXPartials

is fine, but you can't start `ERXPartialsExampleApp` first. Use the built-in H2
viewer application from wherever you have `H2PlugIn.framework` installed:

    java -jar H2PlugIn.framework/Resources/Java/h2-*.jar

Give it the connection URL, and the username `h2user`. This will start up the
in-memory database and the TCP-based server in the right order. You can then
start `ERXPartialsExampleApp`, refresh the viewer, and view the tables created.

#### Using a file-based database

Alternatively, you can use a file-based database, with a connection URL like
this:

    jdbc:h2:file:~/ERXPartials
    
Run `ERXPartialsExampleApp`, wait until migrations have run, quit the
application and then use the H2 viewer application as above with the file URL.

### [FrontBase][frontbase]

Create the database using the Ant target to create the empty database and set
the ownership permissions. Change into the `ERXPartialBaseModel` directory, and
run `ant fb.recreate`:

<pre><code>$ ant fb.recreate
Buildfile: /Volumes/Data/Development/GitHub/ERXPartials/wonder/Tests/ERXPartials/ERXPartialBaseModel/build.xml

init.properties:

fb.recreate:

  [exec] connect to ERXPartials user _system;  
  [exec] Cannot connect to ERXPartials@localhost  
  [exec] Database is not running  
  [exec] stop database;  
  [exec] No current session.  
  [exec] delete database ERXPartials;  
  [exec] Cannot delete database ERXPartials@localhost;  
  [exec] Reason: Database is unknown  
  [exec] create database ERXPartials;  
  [exec] connect to ERXPartials user _system;  
  [exec] Auto committing is on: SET COMMIT TRUE;  
  [exec] create user erxpartial;  
  [exec] set password test user erxpartial;  
  [exec] create schema erxpartial authorization erxpartial;  
  [exec] disconnect all;  
  [exec]  

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 1 second</code></pre>

Alter the connection properties in `ERXPartialsExampleApp/Resources/Properties`
as appropriate:

    dbConnectURLGLOBAL=jdbc:FrontBase://localhost/ERXPartials
    dbConnectUserGLOBAL=erxpartial
    dbConnectPasswordGLOBAL=test

Add the `FrontBasePlugIn.framework` to the application's build path
(right-click on application, Build Path > Configure Build Path... > Libraries >
Add Library... > WebObjects Frameworks > Next, then check FrontBasePlugIn and
click Finish.

Compile and run the `ERXPartialsExampleApp`. The main page is a login page, but
there is no login logic, just click the Login button.


### [PostgreSQL][pgsql]

Create the database.

    $ createdb -U postgres -E UTF8 ERXPartials

Alter the connection properties in `ERXPartialsExampleApp/Resources/Properties`
as appropriate:

    dbConnectURLGLOBAL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/ERXPartials
    dbConnectUserGLOBAL=postgres
    dbConnectPasswordGLOBAL=
    dbConnectPluginGLOBAL=PostgresqlPlugIn
    dbConnectDriverGLOBAL=org.postgresql.Driver

Add the `PostgresqlPlugIn.framework` to the application's build path
(right-click on application, Build Path > Configure Build Path... > Libraries >
Add Library... > WebObjects Frameworks > Next, then check PostgresqlPlugIn and
click Finish.

Compile and run the `ERXPartialsExampleApp`. The main page is a login page, but
there is no login logic, just click the Login button.
